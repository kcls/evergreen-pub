Editable Borrowing History
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can delete titles that you do not wish to appear in your Check Out History. 

 * In "My Account", click on the "Items Checked Out" tab, then the "Check Out History" sub-tab.
 * Check off the items you wish to conceal.
 * Click the Go button next to the "Delete Selected Titles" drop-down box.
 * Click OK in the pop-up to confirm your deletion.  Choose carefully, as there is no "undo".

Deleted titles will also not appear in the downloaded CSV file.
