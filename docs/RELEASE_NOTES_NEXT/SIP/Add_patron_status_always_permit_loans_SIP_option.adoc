Add patron_status_always_permit_loans Option to SIP Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Evergreen now has a new `oils_sip.xml` login attribute called
`patron_status_always_permit_loans` that specifies whether
the charge privileges denied, renewal privilges denied, and
card reported lost flags in the patron status block should be
coerced to permissive values regardless of the actual state
of the patron record. Turning this on works around an issue
where a 2019-12 change by the Hoopla SIP2 client takes those flag
fields into account, but some libraries may not wish those
to block a patron's access to online resources that use
SIP2 to authenticate. This setting can also be set as
an `implementation_config` option; note that if it is set to
'true' or 'false' as a login attribute, the login attribute will
override whatever is set in the `implementation_config`.
