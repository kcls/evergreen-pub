Fine Item Detail Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SIP now suppports enhancements for the Fine Item Detail returned by
by Patron Information Response (code 64).  Different manufacturers
of self-check systems specify the format of the fine item detail
differently.  A new option allows you to select the format to return.

Configuration
+++++++++++++
After installation of Evergreen and SIP, in the Evergreen configuration
directory (typically /openils/conf) the SIP configuration file
oils_sip.xml awaits your modifications to use this feature.

In the <accounts><login> sections, you can add an attribute of the form
    `av_format="__<value>__"`

where __<value>__ is one of thsee values:

* `3m`
* `eg_legacy`
* `swyer_a`
* `swyer_b`

For example:

<login id="sipclient" password="password" institution="gapines" av_format="3m"/>

If you omit the option, 'eg_legacy' will be used as the default.

Currently, the behaviour of `eg_legacy` is close to, but not precisely
that of `3m`.  The `eg_legacy` produces the pre-enhancement behavior in
Evergreen.  Currently, the `swyer_a` behavior is identical to that of
`3m`, but there is no guarantee that this will always be the case.

If you change the brand of your self-check equipment, you may need to
change the value of the option to be consistent with the new brand.
