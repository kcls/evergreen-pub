MARC Import/Export Interface Update (Angular Port)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This MARC Import/Export (AKA Vandelay) interface is now built on
Angular(6) instead of Dojo.  The functionality is consistent with the
previous version of the interface, with minor UI adjustments to match
the Angular style, plus one new interface called 'Recent Imports'

Import Templates
++++++++++++++++

Users may now saves sets of import attributes from the MARC import form as 
named templates.  Users may select a default template, applied on page load 
by default, and users may delete existing templates.

Recent Imports Tab
++++++++++++++++++

This is a new interface which allows users to see active and recent
Vandelay sesssions originating from the same workstation or logged in
user account.  Active sessions include real-time progress information so
the user may track the progress without refreshing the page.

This interface makes it possible to exit the main import tab or the
Vandelay interface altogether and return at a later time to check on
import progress.  It also allows users to kick-off multiple imports at
the same time and follow the status of each in one interace.
